		<h1>Educator News (alpha)</h1>
		<p>Educator News is an ongoing, high-level conversation about issues related to education. It allows people to share and discuss articles of interest to educators and learners.</p>

	 <h3>About Educator News</h3>
	 <p>There are many places to discuss education online, but the effectiveness of many of these conversations is diminished by a number of factors. Some conversations are overly negative, some are highly politicized, and some are simply drowned out by a sea of ads.</p>

	 <p>Educator News aims to facilitate a more focused conversation about news and resources that affect teaching and learning. The site itself is designed to emphasize high-quality, meaningful articles and resources while minimizing and hiding distracting and overly politicized submissions. The comments section is similarly designed to emphasize thoughtful and constructive responses, while minimizing and hiding unconstructive reactions.</p>

	 <p>If you want to know a little more about how Educator News aims to do this, please take a look at the <a href="{% url 'ed_news:guidelines' %}">guidelines</a> and share your feedback.</p>

	 <h3>Who is behind Educator News?</h3>
	 <p>My name is Eric, and I have been a public school teacher for almost 20 years now. I have taught math and sciene in every grade from 6th grade through 12th grade. I have spent most of my life working with at-risk students, which includes gifted students who are frustrated by traditional school structures. I taught for 7 years in New York City, and I have been teaching in southeast Alaska since 2002.</p>

	 <p>I have also been a hobbyist programmer all my life, which means I have a good understanding of the tools and resources that are available to programmers. Programmers have built excellent communication tools for themselves, because clear and effective communication is critical to pulling off large-scale programming projects successfully. One of these resources is <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, a place where programmers can share articles and resources of interest to people in the tech startup world. If you have been led to believe that Hackers are bad people, please understand that true Hackers are people who build things, not people who break things. I want to build high-quality open tools and resources for educators and learners, and Educator News is something I've been want to see built for a while now.</p>

	 <h3>Supporting Educator News</h3>
	 <p>There are a number of ways you can support Educator News, if you would like to see this project succeed.</p>
	 <ul>
		<li><b>Share Feedback: </b> If you have some feedback, I would like to hear it. I would like to hear positive feedback, as well as critical feedback. You can share it directly on this site, and you can share it on the Github page as well. I will try to let you know pretty quickly what is going to be done based on the feedback you share.</li>
		<li><b>Contributing: </b> If you are a Python or Javascript developer, please consider taking a look at the <a href="http://github.com/ehmatthes/educator_news">project on Github</a> and see if there is anything you can offer. I plan to use EN as a basis for a tutorial on Django, as part of the <a href="http://introtopython.org">Intro to Python</a> project I started earlier this year. Any contributions you offer to this site will have a positive impact on the Intro to Python project as well.</li>
		<li><b>Donate to the project: </b> I am committed to keeping Educator News a completely free and open project. Money has done enough damage to the education profession, and I aim to keep money out of this project (there will never be ads on the site, and there will never be a registration fee). That said, it takes a good deal of work to bring a project like this to life. If you would like to support my work on Educator News, please consider tipping me through <a href="http://gittip.com/ehmatthes">Gittip</a>. <p class="li_par">Gittip is a platform that allows people to offer long-term financial support to people who are doing meaningful work on open projects. The basic idea is that many people contribute a small amount each week, and those small amounts add up in a meaningful way. If you have a little to spare in support of this project, I would greatly appreciate the support. I would also love to see the education world adopt Gittip as a funding platform for a number of high-quality open projects in the education field.</p></li>
