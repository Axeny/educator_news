		<h1>Educator News (alpha)</h1>
		<p>Educator News is an ongoing, high-level conversation about issues related to education. It allows people to share and discuss articles of interest to educators and learners.</p>

	 <h3>About Educator News</h3>
	 <p>There are many places to discuss education online, but the effectiveness of many of these conversations is diminished by a number of factors. Some conversations are overly negative, some are highly politicized, and some are simply drowned out by a sea of ads.</p>

	 <p>Educator News aims to facilitate a more focused conversation about news and resources that affect teaching and learning. The site itself is designed to emphasize high-quality, meaningful articles and resources while minimizing and hiding distracting and overly politicized submissions. The comments section is similarly designed to emphasize thoughtful and constructive responses, while minimizing and hiding unconstructive reactions.</p>

	 <p>If you want to know a little more about how Educator News aims to do this, please take a look at the guidelines and share your feedback.</p>

	 <h3>Who is behind Educator News?</h3>
	 <p>My name is Eric, and I have been a public school teacher for almost 20 years now. I have taught math and sciene in every grade from 6th grade through 12th grade. I have spent most of my life working with at-risk students, which includes gifted students who are frustrated by traditional school structures. I taught for 7 years in New York City, and I have been teaching in southeast Alaska since 2002.</p>

	 <p>I have also been a hobbyist programmer all my life, which means I have a good understanding of the tools and resources that are available to programmers. Programmers have built excellent communication tools for themselves, because clear and effective communication is critical to pulling off large-scale programming projects successfully. One of these resources is <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, a place where programmers can share articles and resources of interest to people in the tech startup world. If you have been led to believe that Hackers are bad people, please understand that true Hackers are people who build things, not people who break things. I want to build high-quality open tools and resources for educators and learners, and Educator News is something I've been want to see built for a while now.</p>

	 <p>I am the only person building Educator News right now, but I don't work alone. I draw inspiration and continuously build an understanding of how education should be done from many people. I have the good fortune of working with a highly professional staff every day, including teachers, administrators, mental health professionals, volunteers, and others. I have learned something about education from every student I've ever met, and from every parent I have spoken with. I most appreciate the people who can cut through the bureaucracy that has built up around the education profession, and speak to what teachers and learners need every day.</p>

	 <p>I have many interests outside of the school setting. I have bicycled over 25,000 miles around North America, and at one point I lived on a bicycle for 13 months straight. I like to run, climb mountains, and spend time on the water. I volunteered with a local mountain rescue team for about 8 years, and only stopped that work because I got pretty busy when my son was born. My  son is about to turn three, but I still feel like a new parent most days. I love my family every day I'm alive.</p>


	 <h3>Supporting Educator News</h3>
	 <p>There are a number of ways you can support Educator News, if you would like to see this project succeed.</p>
	 <ul>
		<li><b>Contributing: </b> If you are a Python or Javascript developer, please consider taking a look at the <a href="http://github.com/ehmatthes/educator_news">project on Github</a> and see if there is anything you can offer. I plan to keep all of the code open except for a bit of secret sauce needed to keep the spam from taking over. I also plan to use EN as a basis for a tutorial on Django, as part of the <a href="http://introtopython.org">Intro to Python</a> project I started earlier this year.</li>
		<li><b>Share Feedback: </b> If you have some feedback, positive or critical, I would like to hear it. You can share it directly on a post here, or you can share it on the Github page. I will let you know pretty quickly what is going to be done with the feedback you share.</li>
		<li><b>Donate to the project: </b> I am committed to keeping Educator News a completely free and open project. The code is free and open, the content is available to everyone, and there will never be ads on the site. Money has done enough damage to the education profession, and I aim to keep money out of this project. That said, it's a good deal of work to bring a project like this to life, and it will take some work to maintain the infrastructure so the focus can remain on sharing high-quality submissions and comments. If you would like to support my work on the project, please consider supporting me on <a href="http://gittip.com/ehmatthes">Gittip</a>. Gittip is a platform that allows people to offer long-term financial support to people who are doing meaningful work on open projects. The basic idea is that many people contribute a small amount each week, and that adds up in a meaningful way. If you have a little to spare in support of this project, I would greatly appreciate the support.</li>

I have enjoyed high-level conversations at the schools I have worked at, the conferences I've been to, and in the people I have met in all of my travels. I have looked for a place online that supports an ongoing conversation </p> {% endcomment %}
